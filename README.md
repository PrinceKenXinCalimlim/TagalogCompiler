# TagalogCompiler

### Overview

The Tagalog Compiler is a specialized tool designed to analyze and validate code written in a programming language inspired by Tagalog keywords and syntax. It combines lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis to ensure correctness, making it ideal for teaching programming concepts in a culturally relevant way.

At its core, the compiler consists of modular components: the lexical analyzer identifies tokens, the syntax analyzer checks the structural integrity of the code, and the semantic analyzer verifies the logical accuracy of variable declarations and usage. Together, these components form a robust system for code validation.

The compiler also features a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing users to interact with the tool intuitively. By integrating these functionalities, the Tagalog Compiler serves as both an educational resource and a practical programming tool for learners and developers alike.
